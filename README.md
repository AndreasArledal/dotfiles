# Andreas Arledal dotfiles
ZSH, Prezto, Tmux, Vim, SCM Breeze and more... Managed by [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) from [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/).

## Requirements

## Install
1. Set zsh as your login shell:

        `chsh -s $(which zsh)`

2. Clone this repo onto your computer machine thingy:

        `git clone git://github.com/andreasarledal/dotfiles.git`

3. Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

        `brew tap thoughtbot/formulae`

        Â´brew install rcm`

4. Install the dotfiles:

        `env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup`

After the initial installation, you can run `rcup` without the one-time variable
`RCRC` being set (`rcup` will symlink the repo's `rcrc` to `~/.rcrc` for future
runs of `rcup`). [See
example](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles/blob/master/rcrc).

This command will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.
Setting the `RCRC` environment variable tells `rcup` to use standard
configuration options:

* Exclude the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, which are part of
  the `dotfiles` repository but do not need to be symlinked in.
* Give precedence to personal overrides which by default are placed in
  `~/dotfiles-local`

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

`rcup`

You should run `rcup` after pulling a new version of the repository to symlink
any new files in the repository.
