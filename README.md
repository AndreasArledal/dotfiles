# Andreas Arledal dotfiles
ZSH, Prezto, Tmux, Vim, SCM Breeze and more... Managed by [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) from [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/).

## Install
1. Set zsh as your login shell:

        `chsh -s $(which zsh)`

1. Clone this repo onto your computer machine thingy:

        `git clone git://github.com/andreasarledal/dotfiles.git`

1. Make sure submodules (prezto and scm_breeze are handled as dependencies through git submodules)

        `git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive`

1. Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

        `brew tap thoughtbot/formulae`

        Â´brew install rcm`

1. Install the dotfiles:

        `env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup`

After the initial installation, you can run `rcup` without the one-time variable
`RCRC` being set (`rcup` will symlink the repo's `rcrc` to `~/.rcrc` for future
runs of `rcup`). [See
example](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles/blob/master/rcrc).

This command will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.
Setting the `RCRC` environment variable tells `rcup` to use standard
configuration options:

* Exclude the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, which are part of
  the `dotfiles` repository but do not need to be symlinked in.
* Give precedence to personal overrides which by default are placed in
  `~/dotfiles-local`

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

`rcup`

You should run `rcup` after pulling a new version of the repository to symlink
any new files in the repository.

## Brew packages
There's no hard dependencies for any brew packages but configs for some are included. Therefore 
there is an installation script `brew.sh` that can be run to install packages, it also installs 
rcm.

The following packages is somehow related to the dotfiles:
- rcm
- tmux
- fasd
